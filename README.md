# Dynamic Phone Number Switching jQuery
Switch the phone number based on where traffic is coming from. The code was developed to switch whether the user was coming from a paid Google ad or an organic search lead. The 111-111-1111 number is the paid ad and the 111-111-1112 is orgabic. Each adds a cookie to the browser, but the PPC cookie always trumps the oragnic cookie for one month.
